# Timer
A microservice which allows you to create timers which checks a value every set amount of time. It also allows you to check how many timers are running at one time
A microservice which keeps track of how many users are online aswell as the details of those users. The information is stored inside a redis store using dapr and docker kubernetes. It assigns each user a key in the form of a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) where its information is stored. A list of all the user keys is also stored for ease of access.

# Prerequisites
#### Installation of Docker 
![Docker](https://github.com/AlexanderAzzopardi/UnitConvertor/blob/main/Saved%20Pictures/DockerLogo.jfif)
> <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>

#### Installation of Dapr 
![Dapr](https://github.com/AlexanderAzzopardi/UnitConvertor/blob/main/Saved%20Pictures/DaprLogo.jfif)
> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/dapr-for-net-developers/getting-started>

#### Installation of RestClient
Search **RestClient** in the extension tab and install. 

# Redis Store
When setting up a redis store you need to create a .yaml file 

    apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      name: statestore
      namespace: default
    spec:
      type: state.redis
      version: v1
      metadata:
      - name: redisHost
        value: localhost:6379
      - name: redisPassword
        value: ""
      - name: enableTLS
        value: true # Optional. Allowed: true, false.
      - name: failover
        value: true # Optional. Allowed: true, false.

# Running Timer microservice
To run the useraccount microservice you need to run it via dapr.

> dapr run --app-id "account-service" --app-port "5001" --dapr-grpc-port "50010" --dapr-http-port "5010" -- dotnet run --urls="http://+:5001"

## Creating a Timer
When creating a brand new timer you need to create a method in the *TimerController.cs* which creates the timer while calling the method *Function* each interation.

    [HttpGet("timer")]
    public void Timer(TimerSpec Timer, [FromServices] DaprClient client)
    {
        var autoEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);
        AddTimer(client);
        var stateTimer = new Timer(StatusChecker.Function, autoEvent, Timer.timeDelay, Timer.timeInterval);
        autoEvent.WaitOne();
        stateTimer.Dispose();
        EndTimer(client);
    }
    
A method needs to be created in *StatusCheckerController.cs* which contains the code to be run every time the timer iterates.

    public static void Function(object o)
    {   
        AutoResetEvent autoEvent = (AutoResetEvent)o;
        
        Enter code here...

        autoEvent.Set();
    }
    
## Commands
### Creating an instance of a timer
To create an instance of a timer you need to run a http request, inside a *.http* file, like the one below. *timeDelay* is the delay from the timers creation before it starts (in ms). *timeInterval* is how often the timer ticks (in ms).
    
    GET http://localhost:5020/v1.0/invoke/timer/method/timer HTTP/1.1
    content-type: application/json

    {
        "timeDelay": "",
        "timeInterval": ""
    }

### Checking timers active
This command checks how many timers are currently running.
    
    GET http://localhost:5020/v1.0/invoke/timer/method/timerchecker HTTP/1.1
